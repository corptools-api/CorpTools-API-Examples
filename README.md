# CorptoolsAPI examples
Each file contains GET and POST examples for your Corptools API implementation in various programming languages. Each example is designed to be encapsulated in a single executable file or folder, so you can pull down the code and run it as is. You'll need to update the `access_key` and `secret_key` with your credentials, along with the details of the request paramerters, to fit your own test.
